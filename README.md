# My Reprograma journal

The Reprograma journal is a personal journal about my journey on the Reprograma bootcamp, created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## React concepts used

### Components
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
More details on [Components documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper).

### Props
`props` (short for “properties”) are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. Check out the [W3 Schools documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp).
